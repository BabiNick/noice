# Noice Roadmap

## First things first

These are the first few things we want to get off the ground:

On game states:

* [ ] main menu
* [ ] lobby
* [ ] game start
* [ ] game

On general game logic:

* [ ] entity structure
* [ ] first unit
* [ ] unit collision
* [ ] first unit AI (attacks everything it sees)
* [ ] first base
* [ ] map creation
* [ ] first game mode (simplest)

On networking:

* [ ] lobby logic
* [ ] game creation
* [ ] start thinking about security


## Pre^4 alpha

* [ ] at least simple local game workflow
